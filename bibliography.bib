  abstract = "Phenotypic plasticity is the primary mechanism of organismal
              resilience to abiotic and biotic stress, and genetic
              differentiation in plasticity can evolve if stresses differ among
              populations. Inducible defence is a common form of adaptive
              phenotypic plasticity, and long-standing theory predicts that its
              evolution is shaped by costs of the defensive traits, costs of
              plasticity and a trade-off in allocation to constitutive versus
              induced traits. We used a common garden to study the evolution of
              defence in two native populations of wild arugula Eruca sativa
              (Brassicaceae) from contrasting desert and Mediterranean habitats
              that differ in attack by caterpillars and aphids. We report
              genetic differentiation and additive genetic variance for
              phenology, growth and three defensive traits (toxic
              glucosinolates, anti-nutritive protease inhibitors and physical
              trichome barriers) as well their inducibility in response to the
              plant hormone jasmonic acid. The two populations were strongly
              differentiated for plasticity in nearly all traits. There was
              little evidence for costs of defence or plasticity, but
              constitutive and induced traits showed a consistent additive
              genetic trade-off within each population for the three defensive
              traits. We conclude that these populations have evolutionarily
              diverged in inducible defence and retain ample potential for the
              future evolution of phenotypic plasticity in defence.",
